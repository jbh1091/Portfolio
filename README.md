Collection of small data science projects in Python
DSP: A couple of basic scripts showing how to build customized sine waves (for teaching or simulation)
LondonHousing: Demonstration of cleaning and exploring the London Housing dataset from Kaggle
StockOscillations: Compare different stock tickers within the same sector (here I use airlines) to look for sector leaders or laggers
